# Hugo Tufte CSS (WIP)
A simple, work-in-progress [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme based on the [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css/) style.

**Note**: This fork changes a few things from the above:

- Shorter landing page with only links to content (no details)
- More closely aligns to Tufte style for posts (removes quite a few details)
- Use Hugo pipes for CSS processing

Basic example, ported from Tufte CSS example document: https://alanorth.github.io/hugo-theme-tufte-css/2017/02/tufte-css-is-for-lovers/
